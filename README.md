Hello everyone! This project was an interview's technical assigment, it was done in 2 days.

Here you will find a list of countries wich wou can filter by region and search for a specific country.
When you click in a country card you will navigate to that country's detail page.
From that page you can go back to the list or navigate throught that country borders detail's page.

This project had a lot of first times for me :)
-First time creating a project from start
-First time using dark mode
-First time implementing routes
-First time implementing responsive pages

I usually code in react native, so react.js was also a bit new to me.

How to install the app:
Clone the project from 'https://github.com/angelaalves/where-in-the-world'

run npm install

npm start 
(The default port is localhost:3000)

and it should be it :)
